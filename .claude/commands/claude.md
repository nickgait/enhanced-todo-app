# My First Todo App - Learning Project

## Project Overview
This is my first programming project! I'm building a simple Todo list app to learn the fundamentals of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What I Want to Learn
- How HTML structures web pages
- How CSS makes things look good
- How JavaScript adds interactivity
- Basic programming concepts like variables, functions, arrays, and objects
- How to customize and extend applications

## Current Features
- Add new todos
- Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- Delete todos
- Simple, clean interface
- Responsive design that works on phones

## Project Structure
```

├── claude.md          # This file - project documentation
├── index.html         # Main HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
└── README.md          # Basic project description
```

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. Start adding your todos!

## Next Steps I Want to Learn
- [ ] Separate CSS into its own file
- [ ] Separate JavaScript into its own file  
- [ ] Add due dates to todos
- [ ] Add priority levels (high, medium, low)
- [ ] Add categories/tags
- [ ] Save todos so they persist when I close the browser
- [ ] Add editing functionality
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality
- [ ] Make it look even better with animations

## Questions for Claude
- How do I separate my code into multiple files?
- How can I save todos so they don't disappear when I refresh?
- What's the difference between let, const, and var?
- How do I add more advanced features?
- What should I learn next after mastering this project?

## Learning Notes
Write down what I learn as I build this:

### HTML Concepts Learned:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares HTML5
- `<head>` contains page metadata
- `<body>` contains visible content
- Elements have opening and closing tags
- `id` attributes let JavaScript find elements
- `class` attributes let CSS style elements

### CSS Concepts Learned:
- CSS goes inside `<style>` tags
- Selectors target HTML elements
- Properties change how things look
- Flexbox helps arrange elements
- Colors can be hex codes like #007bff

### JavaScript Concepts Learned:
- Variables store data (`let todos = []`)
- Functions group related code
- Arrays hold multiple items
- Objects group related properties
- Event handlers make pages interactive
- DOM manipulation changes the webpage

## Code Questions & Explanations
(I'll ask Claude to explain specific lines or concepts here as I encounter them)
